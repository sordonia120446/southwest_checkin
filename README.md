## Summary

Automate Southwest flight checkins.  Uses nightmare.js.  And maybe Docker in the future, if I feel like it.

## How to use

### Setup

Get node if you don't already have it.  And I guess Electron too?

Then, run `npm install`.

### Execution

Run `npm start`.  You'll need to change in the code the confirmation number.  Cuz I was too lazy to make it easy :)

###

## Dependencies

Nightmare.js
Node (used v10 during development of this)
Electron

OR

Docker
docker-compose
